# ICKNNI-And-CCKNNI

## Insight
Incomplete case KNN and Complete case KNN imputation are two data mining algorithms, which compute the missing values in datasets by utilizing the shortest path technique. Our work outlined the normalized root mean square (NRMS) efficiency of these algorithms and identifies the best suitable for discrete datasets.
